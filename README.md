# [codepuzzle.de](http://codepuzzle.de) behind the scenes

This is the source of my humble and content-starving website, with my picture saying hello to the world and 2 lines about what I do. It's a haml & sass built static website with minor CSS3 gimmicks mostly recognized by Google Chrome and their corresponding jQuery fallbacks (at least a few).
